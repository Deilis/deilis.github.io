## About Me

I am Deividas Lis, a Cyber Threat Intelligence Researcher based in Vilnius, Lithuania, with a deep focus on Cyber Threat Intelligence for B2C & Company security. Over my career, I have demonstrated expertise in developing advanced threat detection solutions, leading initiatives to combat cybercrime, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to enhance overall security posture. My professional journey has included roles both in law enforcement and the private sector, allowing me to gain a well-rounded understanding of the cyber threat landscape.

Currently, as a Senior Cyber Threat Intelligence Researcher and Team Representative at Nord Security, I design and implement detection rules to enhance threat detection accuracy and mitigate false positives, with a focus on protecting users from phishing, scams, and other cyber threats.

Previously, as a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Cencora and an investigator with the Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau, I focused on identifying and mitigating emerging threats, conducting complex cybercrime investigations, and analyzing vast data sets to uncover patterns and indicators of compromise. I have extensive experience leading investigations, collaborating with international law enforcement, and using advanced OSINT techniques to combat cybercrime.

In addition to my professional expertise, I specialize in Python scripting, threat intelligence, and security rule creation. I am dedicated to advancing cybersecurity through innovative research, automation, and effective cross-industry collaboration.
